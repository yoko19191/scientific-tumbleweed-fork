# Execution Lock

> **⚠️ This file is a REFERENCE skeleton for Strategist — do NOT copy it verbatim into a project.** When producing `<project_path>/spec_lock.md`, emit only the structural `##` sections with their filled-in `-` data lines. Do NOT carry over any `>` blockquote guidance, callout boxes, HARD-rule notes, or `> ```code fence` override examples from this file — those are author-time guidance for Strategist, not runtime data. The output is a machine-readable contract; every line must be parseable data.
>
> Machine-readable execution contract. Executor MUST `read_file` this before every SVG page. Values NOT listed here must NOT appear in SVGs. For design narrative (rationale, audience, style), see `design_spec.md`.
>
> After SVG generation begins, this file is the canonical source for color / font / icon / image values. Modifications should go through `scripts/update_spec.py` so both this file and the generated SVGs stay in sync.

## canvas
- viewBox: 0 0 1280 720
- format: PPT 16:9

> Strategist: fill the viewBox and format for the chosen canvas. Common values: `0 0 1280 720` (PPT 16:9), `0 0 1024 768` (PPT 4:3), `0 0 1242 1660` (Xiaohongshu), `0 0 1080 1080` (WeChat Moments), `0 0 1080 1920` (Story).

## colors
- bg: #FFFFFF
- primary: #......
- accent: #......
- secondary_accent: #......
- text: #......
- text_secondary: #......
- border: #......

> Strategist: fill only the colors actually used in this deck. Extra rows may be added; unused rows should be deleted rather than left as `#......`.

## typography
- font_family: "Microsoft YaHei", Arial, sans-serif
- title_family: Georgia, SimSun, serif
- body_family: "Microsoft YaHei", "PingFang SC", Arial, sans-serif
- emphasis_family: Georgia, SimSun, serif
- code_family: Consolas, "Courier New", monospace
- body: 22
- title: 32
- subtitle: 24
- annotation: 14

> **All five family lines are listed explicitly** so Strategist considers every role when filling this block — easy to forget `code_family` or `emphasis_family` otherwise. In a real project's `spec_lock.md`:
> - Keep any `*_family` whose role genuinely differs from `font_family`.
> - **Omit** any `*_family` whose value would equal `font_family` — Executor falls back to `font_family` for missing roles, so writing it twice is noise. (Exception: keep `code_family` even if equal, since it's the conceptually distinct monospace role.)
>
> `font_family` is the default fallback for roles without an explicit override. Every declared family is a CSS font-stack string.
>
> **Source of these strings**: they are the *Per-role font stacks* list from `design_spec.md §IV Font Plan` — copy across verbatim. The breakdown table in `design_spec.md` (Chinese / English / Fallback columns) is the human-readable accompaniment; the ordered CSS stack strings live here (and in `design_spec.md`) and must match character-for-character. Stack **order** carries browser-rendering intent (Latin-led vs. CJK-led) that the breakdown table alone cannot encode — see the explainer in `design_spec.md §IV`.
>
> Sizes (`body` / `title` / etc.) are in px, matching SVG native units. `body` is the **required baseline anchor** — every other size in the deck is derived as a ratio of it (see ramp table in `design_spec_reference.md §IV`).
>
> **Size slots are anchors, not a closed menu.** The common slots (`title` / `subtitle` / `annotation`) cover frequent cases. Add role-specific slots (e.g. `cover_title: 72`, `hero_number: 48`, `chart_annotation: 13`) when a deck genuinely needs them — this is expected for cover-heavy decks, consulting-style hero numbers, and information-dense pages. Executor may use intermediate sizes as long as the size's ratio to `body` sits within the corresponding role's band in the ramp table.
>
> **⚠️ PPT-safe stack discipline (HARD rule).** PPTX stores one `typeface` per text run; there is no runtime fallback. Every stack here MUST end with a cross-platform pre-installed font: `"Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` / `SimSun, serif` / `Arial, sans-serif` / `"Times New Roman", serif` / `Consolas, "Courier New", monospace`. Non-pre-installed fonts (Inter / Google Fonts / brand typefaces) may lead the stack only when the Design Spec explicitly notes the font-install or font-embedding requirement.
>
> **Stack length discipline.** 3-4 fonts per stack is the sweet spot. Converter only writes the **first** Latin and **first** CJK font into PPTX — everything after is silently dropped. macOS-only families (`Songti SC`, `Menlo`, `Monaco`, `Helvetica`) are auto-mapped to their Windows equivalents via `FONT_FALLBACK_WIN` (see `scripts/svg_to_pptx/drawingml_utils.py`), so stacking both the macOS family and its Windows equivalent is redundant. Lead with Windows-preinstalled fonts (`Microsoft YaHei` / `SimSun` / `Arial` / `Georgia` / `Consolas`); keep at most **one** macOS-exclusive family (typically `"PingFang SC"`) as a browser-preview nicety.

## icons
- library: chunk
- inventory: target, bolt, shield, users, chart-bar, lightbulb

> `library` MUST be `chunk`. `inventory` lists the approved icon names (without library prefix); Executor may only use icons from this list.

## images
- cover_bg: images/cover_bg.jpg

> One entry per image file actually used. Remove the section entirely if the deck uses no images.

## page_rhythm
- P01: anchor
- P02: dense
- P03: breathing
- P04: dense
- P05: dense
- P06: breathing
- P07: anchor

> One entry per page. Key format: `P<NN>` (zero-padded two-digit page index matching `§IX Content Outline` in `design_spec.md`). Value is one of the three rhythm tags below. This field exists to break the "every page looks the same" pattern — Executor reads it per page and applies the tag's layout discipline.
>
> **Vocabulary** (exactly these three values):
> - `anchor` — Structural pages (cover / chapter opener / TOC / ending). Follow the corresponding template as-is.
> - `dense` — Information-heavy pages (data, KPIs, comparisons, multi-point lists). Card grids, multi-column layouts, tables, and charts are all permitted.
> - `breathing` — Low-density pages (single concept, hero quote, big image + caption, section transition). Avoid **multi-card grid layouts** (multiple parallel rounded containers as the primary content structure); organize with naked text, dividers, whitespace, or full-bleed imagery instead. Single rounded visual elements (hero image corners, callouts, tags, one emphasis block) are fine. Proportions follow information weight — not a preset ratio menu.
>
> **Rhythm follows narrative** (for Strategist when filling this section): `breathing` pages appear where the narrative genuinely pauses — section transitions, a single argument worth standalone emphasis, a deliberate stop after a dense sequence. A high-density data briefing or consulting analysis may legitimately be nearly all `dense` — **do not invent filler pages** to pad the rhythm. Validation: every `breathing` page must answer "what independent thing is this page saying?".
>
> **Missing or empty section** → Executor falls back to `dense` for every page (current pre-rhythm behavior). Remove the whole section only for legacy decks; new decks authored by Strategist MUST fill it.
