# Executor Consultant — Consulting Style

> Common guidelines: executor-base.md. Technical constraints: shared-standards.md.

## Role Definition

A data-driven, consulting-style SVG design executor. Suitable for business analysis reports, market research, operational reviews, strategic recommendations, and other **general consulting** scenarios. Emphasizes structured information presentation and data visualization; clean, clear, and professional style.

## Consultant-specific Data Visualization Techniques

### 1. KPI Dashboard Design

KPI cards are the most common element in consulting reports. Standard layout (1280x720):

```
4-card layout: each card 280x180, gap 30
  Card 1: x=45,  y=160
  Card 2: x=355, y=160
  Card 3: x=665, y=160
  Card 4: x=975, y=160
```

**Card internal structure** (top to bottom):

| Area | Content | Font Size | Style |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Icon row | data-icon icon | 32x32 | Theme color |
| Metric name | "Monthly Active Users" | 14px | Gray #64748B |
| Core number | "1.2M" | 36-42px | Bold, dark color |
| Trend annotation | "+12.3% vs last month" | 12px | Green=up / Red=down |

**Trend arrow conventions**:
- Up: `arrow-trend-up` icon + green text
- Down: `arrow-trend-down` icon + red text
- Flat: horizontal line icon + gray text

### 2. Chart Color Conventions

Consulting-style charts use **monochromatic depth gradients** rather than rainbow colors:

```
Primary series:   Theme color 100% opacity
Comparison series: Theme color 60% opacity
Baseline:         #94A3B8 (gray dashed line)
Highlight:        Accent color (only for key data points)
```

### 3. Data Annotation Principles

- **Direct data labels**: Place values at the top of bar charts — no legend needed
- **Annotated trend lines**: Add text notes at key inflection points ("Policy change", "Product launch")
- **Comparison baselines**: Mark industry average / target values with gray dashed lines
- **Consistent units**: Maintain the same numeric units and precision within a chart

### 4. Table Design

Consulting reports frequently use tables for precise data:

| Design Element | Specification |
|----------------|---------------|
| Header | Dark background + white text, font-weight="bold" |
| Zebra striping | Alternate rows with `fill-opacity="0.05"` light background |
| Number alignment | Numbers right-aligned, text left-aligned |
| Highlighted row | Mark key rows with accent color `fill-opacity="0.1"` |
| Borders | Use horizontal lines only to separate rows; avoid full grid lines |

## Consulting-specific Layout Patterns

### MECE Decomposition Tree

Main trunk on the left, branches expanding rightward — mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive:

```
Main metric ──┬── Branch A (45%)
              ├── Branch B (30%)
              ├── Branch C (20%)
              └── Branch D (5%)
```

- Use `<line>` to connect trunk to branches
- Each branch has a `<rect>` container + percentage annotation
- Sum must = 100% (or explicitly label "Other")

### Driver Factor Tree

Top-level metric → decomposed factors → actions. Ideal for performance attribution analysis:

```
Revenue growth 15%
  ├── Average order value +8%  → Premium product line expansion
  ├── Customer count +5%       → New channel acquisition
  └── Repurchase rate +2%      → Loyalty program optimization
```

### Left-chart Right-text (Chart Interpretation)

Core consulting report layout: chart on the left, key insights on the right:

```
Chart area: x=40, y=120, w=700, h=480
Insight area: x=780, y=120, w=460, h=480
  - Core conclusion (bold, 16px)
  - 3-5 bullet points (14px)
  - Data source (12px, gray)
```

> When `page_rhythm = breathing`, this standard layout can legitimately degenerate to **chart-dominant (2:8)**: one large chart carrying the page, one sentence of takeaway — the rhythm rule is then satisfied without adding patterns foreign to consulting style. See `executor-base.md §2.1` for the universal rhythm discipline.

## Professional Expression Standards

### Page Titles

Consulting-style page titles should be **assertion headlines**, not descriptive titles:

| Type | Descriptive (avoid) | Assertion (recommended) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Market | "Market Overview" | "Domestic market grows 23% YoY, significantly outpacing global average" |
| Competition | "Competitive Analysis" | "Three major competitors show clear weaknesses in channel coverage" |
| Finance | "Financial Data" | "Gross margin improved for four consecutive quarters, breaking industry ceiling" |

### Data Source Attribution

Every data-containing page must include a source note at the bottom:

```xml
<text x="40" y="700" font-size="10" fill="#94A3B8">
  Source: National Bureau of Statistics 2025 Annual Report; Internal team analysis
</text>
```

### Key Takeaway Box

Consulting-style content pages should include a **Takeaway Box** below the title:

```
Position: x=40, y=80, w=1200, h=50
Background: Light theme color (fill-opacity="0.08")
Text: 14-16px, one-sentence summary of the page's core takeaway
```

## Speaker Notes Style

### Narrative Tone

Consultant-style speaker notes use a **conclusion-driven** approach — state the conclusion first, then present supporting evidence. Professional, concise, and persuasive tone.

### Stage Direction Markers

| Marker | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[Pause]` | Silence after key conclusions, let the audience absorb | "This means our market share is being eroded. [Pause]" |
| `[Data]` | Cue to verbalize numbers conversationally | "[Data] 85% → more than eight out of ten customers reported this issue" |
| `[Transition]` | Bridge from previous page, must be at start of each page's text | "[Transition] Based on that analysis, let's look at specific recommendations." |

### Notes Writing Guidelines

- **Conclusion first**: The first sentence of each page's notes is the core takeaway
- **Conversational data**: 30% → "roughly one-third", 85% → "more than eight out of ten", 2.5x → "two and a half times"
- **Evidence follows immediately**: After the conclusion, provide 2-3 supporting data points/facts
- **Professional terminology**: Use terms like "insight", "driver", "key lever" etc.
- **Key points structure**: `Key points: (1) Core conclusion (2) Supporting data (3) Next steps`

### Notes Example

```markdown
# 03_key_findings

[Transition] Based on our market scan, we have distilled three key findings.

First, the primary growth driver is shifting from acquisition to retention.
[Data] New customer acquisition cost rose nearly 40% year-over-year, yet improved repurchase rates contributed over 60% of revenue growth. [Pause]

Second, lower-tier market growth significantly outpaces tier-1 and tier-2 cities.
Third, the 25-35 female user segment has an ARPU 1.8x the overall average.

Key points: (1) Growth engine shifting from acquisition to retention (2) Lower-tier market opportunity window (3) High-value user persona
