# Overview

Use this skill to produce one markdown review file that improves scientific quality first and writing quality second.

## Default behavior

1. Read the full manuscript before writing findings.
2. Use extra thinking by default.
3. Write one standalone markdown review file to `paper-reviews/{title}-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`, unless the user gives a different path.
4. Keep the file plain markdown and easy to read.
5. Focus on concrete issues and fixes, not generic reviewer prose.
6. Do not require a fixed review template or section layout unless the user asks for one.
7. Treat `proofread`, `flag typos`, `grammar`, `writing quality`, and similar wording as a request to spend more budget on the editorial sweep after the technical audit.

## Primary objective

Prioritize technical correctness over prose quality.

If attention is limited, spend it in this order:

1. equations, derivations, notation, units, definitions, and algorithmic correctness
2. consistency between claims, evidence, figures, tables, captions, and conclusions
3. editorial quality, with special attention to high-confidence issues that are cheap to verify and fix

Do not let editorial findings crowd out technical findings.

## What extra thinking is for

Spend extra thinking on:

- whether the paper's main claims are actually supported by the manuscript
- whether equations, notation, units, and quantitative statements are internally consistent
- whether appendix formulas and implementation-facing expressions are correct and unambiguous
- whether inverse-trig expressions, coordinate transforms, and branch conventions are correctly specified
- whether abstract, results, figures, tables, and conclusion agree
- whether claims are overstated, under-qualified, or missing key caveats
- whether any statements seem factually wrong, unsupported, or need verification
- whether there are obvious, high-confidence editorial defects that are fast to confirm and worth surfacing

Do not narrate the reasoning process.

## Workflow

1. Read the full manuscript to understand the main claims, evidence, equations, appendices, and structure.
2. Identify the highest-risk technical content:
   - key equations and derivations
   - symbol definitions
   - quantitative claims
   - coordinate transformations
   - appendix formulas
   - implementation-facing expressions
3. Perform a technical audit first.
4. Re-check the highest-risk technical findings.
5. Perform a bounded editorial pass after the technical audit.
6. If code execution is available, run `scripts/proofing_scan.py` (or otherwise do the manual pattern scan described below) to catch high-confidence copy/notation defects that are easy to miss.
7. Perform one short final proofing sweep for obvious, high-confidence editorial issues that are cheap to verify.
8. Write the review file.

For long papers, inspect sections in chunks when helpful, but do not force a multi-pass ritual if it does not improve the review.

## Technical audit

### Notation/terminology drift check (required)

For frequently used symbols (especially subscripted/superscripted angles, radii, and frame labels), record:

- where the symbol is first defined
- the **verbal descriptor** attached to it (e.g., “final polar angle at the source radius”)
- any later descriptor variants (e.g., “initial inclination”) and whether they conflict

Flag conflicts where the same symbol is described with inconsistent temporal/role adjectives (initial/final, source/observer, emission/reception) even if the equations are otherwise correct. These often indicate a real conceptual bug or an implementation-facing ambiguity.

Explicitly check for:

- unsupported or overstated claims
- conclusions that do not follow from the reported results
- inconsistencies between text, equations, figures, tables, and captions
- undefined symbols or symbols used before definition
- notation drift between sections or between the main text and appendix
- unit errors or dimensional inconsistencies
- arithmetic or quantitative inconsistencies
- sign errors, missing factors, normalization ambiguity, or missing case distinctions
- inverse-trig, branch, or quadrant ambiguity, for example `arctan(x/y)` where `atan2` or an explicit branch convention may be needed
- coordinate-system ambiguity, including misuse of terms like initial, final, source, observer, local, global, polar, or azimuthal
- equations that are plausible in prose but ambiguous or wrong as written for implementation
- mismatch between a mathematical definition and an appendix or code-facing formula
- missing assumptions, qualifiers, or uncertainty that materially affect interpretation
- factual statements that appear unsupported or likely incorrect

When judging technical content, distinguish clearly between:

- **definite error:** contradicted by the manuscript itself or by straightforward math, logic, or internal evidence
- **unsupported claim:** stated more strongly than the manuscript supports
- **likely issue:** plausibly wrong or misleading, but not fully provable from the manuscript alone
- **needs external verification:** may depend on outside literature or facts not established in the manuscript

Do not present verification-needed items as definite errors.

## Coverage requirement

If the manuscript contains equations, derivations, appendices, or implementation formulas, inspect them explicitly.

Do not finish the review without checking the key technical content for:

- branch conventions
- sign conventions
- symbol definitions
- dimensional consistency
- implementation ambiguity

If no concrete technical issues are found, say explicitly that these checks were performed and no concrete issues were identified.

## Editorial review

Editorial review is secondary to technical review, but it is still part of the job.

Look for:

- typos, spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues
- awkward, vague, or ambiguous phrasing
- sentences that obscure a technical point
- broken references or citation mismatches
- inconsistent terminology or notation
- local wording that could be made clearer or more precise
- malformed sentences in derivations or equation-adjacent prose
- obvious bibliography defects, including duplicated punctuation and malformed quoted titles
- capitalization or styling mistakes in proper names, product names, languages, or branded terms
- reference-list hygiene (required): duplicated punctuation (e.g., `, ,` or `" , ,`), malformed quoted titles, inconsistent capitalization, and obvious citation-format glitches

Separate editorial issues into two buckets mentally:

1. **meaningful editorial issues:** affect meaning, create technical ambiguity, or noticeably reduce professionalism
2. **bounded proofing issues:** minor but obvious, high-confidence, low-cost defects that are fast to verify and fix

Always include the meaningful editorial issues.

Also include a bounded number of proofing issues when they are obvious and unambiguous, especially when they occur in:

- derivation-heavy sections
- appendices with implementation formulas
- headings, captions, or references
- repeated terminology or capitalization

Do not spend space on subjective line editing or stylistic preferences.

Cap bounded proofing issues at a small number unless the user explicitly asks for exhaustive proofreading.

## Final proofing sweep

### Mandatory micro-proofing pattern scan (required)

Do a quick, mechanical scan for high-yield, high-confidence defects and include any hits as proofing-sweep items:

- duplicated punctuation and spacing artifacts: `, ,`, `,,`, `..`, `" , ,`, `" ,` variants
- semicolon capitalization anomalies: `;` followed by a capital letter where the second clause is not a new sentence/proper noun
- malformed equation-adjacent grammar frames (common in derivations): `into … into …`, `with … into …`, “plugging … into together …”
- programming/product-name capitalization: JavaScript, iOS, iPhone, etc.
- quadrant/branch ambiguity patterns, especially `arctan(x/y)`-style expressions that should be `atan2(y,x)` or require an explicit branch convention

If code execution is available, prefer running `scripts/proofing_scan.py` (below) and then spot-check the top hits.

Example command:

- `python scripts/proofing_scan.py <path-to-pdf-or-text> --max-hits 80`

Use the returned hits as candidates for the proofing-sweep subsection, and spot-check each before presenting it as an issue.

Before finishing, ask silently:

- Are there any obvious, high-confidence editorial issues still on the page that I can name precisely?
- Did I check the bibliography or references for duplicated punctuation, broken quotation punctuation, or citation-format glitches?
- Did I check dense derivation prose near equations for malformed sentences?
- Did I check appendices for capitalization, terminology, or implementation-facing copy issues?

If yes, include the best few findings instead of omitting them.

## Output contract

Write Markdown only.

Do not force a rigid section structure.

Structure the review in whatever way is clearest and most compact, but make sure it covers:

- overall assessment of manuscript quality
- the most important technical findings
- any meaningful editorial findings
- a short proofing-sweep subsection when there are obvious high-confidence copyediting defects worth fixing
- the highest-priority fixes
- any items that need external verification

For each technical finding, include:

- location
- problem
- why it matters
- suggested fix

For each editorial finding, include:

- location
- problem
- why it matters
- suggested fix
- optional candidate rewrite for sentence-level edits

For proofing-sweep items, a compact bullet list is acceptable if each bullet includes:

- location
- problem
- suggested fix

Put technical and factual issues before prose issues unless the user explicitly asks for a prose-first review.

## Writing rules

- Prefer concrete issues over generic praise or commentary.
- Prefer local, checkable technical failures over broad interpretive commentary.
- Prefer evidence-backed findings over stylistic preferences.
- Keep the review concise and operational.
- If a section of the paper is clean, omit filler.
- If there are only a few real issues, say so and keep the review short.
- Do not pad the review with low-value prose edits when technical scrutiny should be the focus.
- Good findings are things like:
  - branch ambiguity in an inverse-trig expression
  - inconsistent variable definition
  - dimensional mismatch
  - undefined symbol in a key equation
  - mismatch between a derivation and an appendix formula
  - malformed sentence in a dense technical derivation
  - duplicated punctuation in a reference entry
  - capitalization error in a proper name or implementation-facing term
- Lower-value findings are things like:
  - generic overclaiming language without a concrete technical issue
  - broad style commentary
  - subjective rewrite suggestions that do not improve correctness or clarity

## Update behavior

Create a new timestamped markdown review file by default, using `{title}-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`.

Only update an existing review file if the user explicitly asks.

Compilation into PDF is not required unless the user asks for it.

## References

Use `references/review-rubric.md` if it provides a useful review checklist.
