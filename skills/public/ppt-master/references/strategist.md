## 1. Eight Confirmations Process

🚧 **GATE — Mandatory read before proceeding**: Before starting analysis or writing any part of the Design Specification, you **MUST** `read_file` the reference template:
```
read_file templates/design_spec_reference.md
```
The design_spec.md output **MUST** follow this template's structure exactly (Sections I through XI). After writing, perform a section-by-section self-check: I Project Information ✓ → II Canvas Spec ✓ → III Visual Theme ✓ → IV Typography ✓ → V Layout Principles ✓ → VI Icon Usage ✓ → VII Visualization Reference List ✓ → VIII Image Resource List ✓ → IX Content Outline ✓ → X Speaker Notes Requirements ✓ → XI Technical Constraints Reminder ✓. Any missing section must be completed before outputting the file.

⛔ **BLOCKING**: After completing the read above, provide professional recommendations for the following eight items, then **present them as a bundled package to the user and wait for explicit confirmation or modifications**.

> **Execution discipline**: This is the last BLOCKING checkpoint in the pipeline (besides template selection). Once the user confirms, the AI must automatically complete the Design Specification & Content Outline and seamlessly proceed to subsequent image generation (if applicable), SVG generation, and post-processing — no additional questions or pauses in between.

### a. Canvas Format Confirmation

Recommend format based on scenario (see Canvas Format Quick Reference above).

### b. Page Count Confirmation

Provide specific page count recommendation based on source document content volume.

### c. Key Information Confirmation

Confirm target audience, usage occasion, and core message; provide initial assessment based on document nature.

### d. Style Objective Confirmation

| Style | Core Focus | Target Audience | One-line Description |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **A) General Versatile** | Visual impact first | Public / clients / trainees | "Catch the eye at a glance" |
| **B) General Consulting** | Data clarity first | Teams / management | "Let data speak" |
| **C) Top Consulting** | Logical persuasion first | Executives / board | "Lead with conclusions" |

**Style selection decision tree**:

```
Content characteristics?
  ├── Heavy imagery / promotional ──→ A) General Versatile
  ├── Data analysis / progress report ──→ B) General Consulting
  └── Strategic decisions / persuading executives ──→ C) Top Consulting

Audience?
  ├── Public / clients / trainees ────→ A) General Versatile
  ├── Teams / management ────────────→ B) General Consulting
  └── Executives / board / investors → C) Top Consulting
```

### e. Color Scheme Recommendation

Proactively provide a color scheme (HEX values) based on content characteristics and industry.

**Industry color quick reference** (full 14-industry list in `scripts/config.py` under `INDUSTRY_COLORS`):

| Industry | Primary Color | Characteristics |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Finance / Business | `#003366` Navy Blue | Stable, trustworthy |
| Technology / Internet | `#1565C0` Bright Blue | Innovative, energetic |
| Healthcare / Health | `#00796B` Teal Green | Professional, reassuring |
| Government / Public Sector | `#C41E3A` Red | Authoritative, dignified |

**Color rules**: 60-30-10 rule (primary 60%, secondary 30%, accent 10%); text contrast ratio >= 4.5:1; no more than 4 colors per page.

### f. Icon Usage Confirmation

| Option | Approach | Suitable Scenarios |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **A** | Emoji | Casual, playful, social media |
| **B** | AI-generated | Custom style needed |
| **C** | Built-in icon library | Professional scenarios (recommended) |
| **D** | Custom icons | Has brand assets |

Built-in library contains 640 icons:

| Library | Style | Count | Prefix | When to use |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `chunk` | fill · straight-line geometry (sharp corners, rectilinear) | 640 | `chunk/` | All scenarios |

> **Mandatory rules when choosing C**:
> 1. Use the `chunk` library — sharp, rectilinear geometry matches academic and technical presentations well.
>    - If the library lacks an exact icon, find the closest alternative within `chunk`.
> 2. Search for icon availability: `ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/chunk/ | grep <keyword>`
> 3. Use the verified filename (without `.svg`) as the icon name
> 4. Always include the library prefix (e.g., `chunk/home`)
> 5. List the final icon inventory in the Design Spec; Executor may only use icons from this list
>
> **Do NOT preload any index file** — use `ls | grep` to search on demand with zero token cost.

### g. Typography Plan Confirmation (Font + Size)

#### Font Combinations

> **Starting points, not a menu.** Each row below is one common direction — pick the closest match and adapt, or propose a new combination when the content tone calls for it. Per-role assignment is expected: `title` / `body` / `emphasis` / `code` may each use a different family. A deck is not required to stick to one family throughout.
>
> **⚠️ PPT-safe font discipline (HARD rule).** PPTX stores a single `typeface` per text run — there is no runtime fallback stack. On a machine that lacks the declared font, PowerPoint substitutes with its own default (typically Calibri), breaking the design. Therefore every CSS `font-family` stack declared in the spec MUST end with a cross-platform pre-installed font:
> - CJK-capable stacks → end with `"Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` (sans) or `SimSun, serif` (serif)
> - Latin-only stacks → end with `Arial, sans-serif` or `"Times New Roman", serif`
> - Monospace stacks → end with `Consolas, "Courier New", monospace`
>
> Any stack that *leads* with a non-pre-installed font (Inter / HarmonyOS Sans / any Google Fonts family / any brand-specific typeface like McKinsey Bower) is only acceptable when the Design Spec explicitly notes "requires the target machine to have this font installed, or the PPTX to embed it." Never leave a non-safe font as the final fallback.

**Cross-platform pre-installed reference** (Windows + Mac out of the box):

| Category | Safe families |
|----------|--------------|
| CJK sans | Microsoft YaHei, SimHei, PingFang SC, Heiti SC |
| CJK serif | SimSun, FangSong, KaiTi, Songti SC, STSong |
| Latin sans | Arial, Calibri, Segoe UI, Verdana, Helvetica, Helvetica Neue |
| Latin serif | Times New Roman, Georgia, Cambria, Times, Palatino |
| Monospace | Consolas, Courier New, Menlo, Monaco |
| Display | Impact, Arial Black |

**Seed combinations** (all stacks are PPT-safe — end on pre-installed fonts):

| Direction | Typical scenarios | Title stack | Body stack | Code stack |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Modern CJK sans** (default) | Tech launches, enterprise reports, most contemporary decks | `"Microsoft YaHei", "PingFang SC", sans-serif` | same as Title | — |
| **Government / 政务** | Government reports, party-building, formal briefings | `SimHei, "Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` | `SimSun, serif` | — |
| **Academic serif** | Research, legal, theses, serious analysis | `Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif` | `"Times New Roman", SimSun, serif` | — |
| **Editorial display** | Magazine covers, luxury, finance, brand storytelling | `Georgia, SimSun, serif` (Bold/Heavy) | `"Microsoft YaHei", "PingFang SC", sans-serif` | — |
| **Tech / developer** | Code-focused tech talks, developer docs, API / CLI explainers | `Arial, sans-serif` | same as Title | `Consolas, "Courier New", monospace` |
| **International English** | English-primary decks, international audiences | `"Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif` | same as Title | — |
| **Impact / 海报** | Cover headlines, call-to-action, poster-style slides | `Impact, "Arial Black", "Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` | `"Microsoft YaHei", "PingFang SC", sans-serif` | — |

> **Stack length discipline (soft rule).** 3-4 fonts per stack is enough — more is waste. Converter behavior (see [`drawingml_utils.py parse_font_family`](../scripts/svg_to_pptx/drawingml_utils.py)) only picks the **first** Latin font and the **first** CJK font; everything after is silently dropped in PPTX. macOS-only families (`Songti SC` → SimSun; `Menlo` / `Monaco` → Consolas; `Helvetica` → Arial) are mapped via `FONT_FALLBACK_WIN`, so stacking both the macOS family and its Windows equivalent is redundant. Convention: lead with Windows-preinstalled fonts (Microsoft YaHei / SimSun / Arial / Georgia / Consolas) so PPT viewers see the intended typeface immediately; keep at most **one** macOS-exclusive family (typically `"PingFang SC"`) as a browser-preview nicety.

> **Directions that require font installation or embedding** (NOT in the safe seed table above):
> - **Retro / pixel** — Press Start 2P / VT323 / Silkscreen (not pre-installed on any OS; degrades to a wildly different font without install)
> - **Rounded friendly** — Nunito / Quicksand / M PLUS Rounded / OPPO Sans (no true cross-platform rounded pre-installed; closest safe substitutes are `Trebuchet MS` / `Verdana` but they are not truly rounded)
> - **Modern web sans** — Inter / HarmonyOS Sans / Source Han Sans / Noto Sans (not pre-installed; viewers without the font see Calibri)
> - **Brand-specific typography** — McKinsey Bower, Anthropic house fonts, corporate VI typefaces
>
> Only declare these when the deck runs on controlled machines (all viewers install the font first) or when the PPTX embeds the font. Always note the constraint in the Design Spec.
>
> **Guidance for the Strategist**: state the intended direction in one phrase (e.g., "modern CJK sans"), then list the actual families per role in the design spec. The spec is the source of truth; the table above is only a quick pick.

#### Font Size Ramp (all sizes in px)

> **Ramp discipline, not a fixed menu.** Every size in the deck is derived from the `body` baseline as a ratio. The `spec_lock.md typography` block declares `body` as the anchor plus whichever common slots this deck actually uses (`title` / `subtitle` / `annotation` by default; add `cover_title` / `hero_number` / `chart_annotation` etc. when the content calls for them). Executor may use intermediate sizes during generation as long as the size's ratio to `body` lands within the corresponding role's band below — the list is a ramp, not an allowed-values enumeration.

Selection principle: Baseline choice is driven by **content density**, not design style.

| Content Density | Points per Page | Body Baseline | Suitable Scenarios |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Relaxed | 3-5 items | 24px | Keynote-style, training materials |
| Dense | 6+ items | 18px | Data reports, consulting analysis |

| Level | Ratio to body | 24px baseline | 18px baseline |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Cover title (hero headline) | 2.5-5x | 60-120px | 45-90px |
| Chapter / section opener | 2-2.5x | 48-60px | 36-45px |
| Page title | 1.5-2x | 36-48px | 27-36px |
| Hero number (consulting KPIs) | 1.5-2x | 36-48px | 27-36px |
| Subtitle | 1.2-1.5x | 29-36px | 22-27px |
| **Body** | **1x** | **24px** | **18px** |
| Annotation / caption | 0.7-0.85x | 17-20px | 13-15px |
| Page number / footnote | 0.5-0.65x | 12-16px | 9-12px |

> Executor may pick any px value within a role's band (e.g., 40px hero number, 13px chart annotation, 72px cover headline) without having to pre-declare every intermediate value in `spec_lock.md`. Values outside **every** band remain forbidden — those need the lock extended first.

### h. Image Usage Confirmation

| Option | Approach | Suitable Scenarios |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **A** | No images | Data reports, process documentation |
| **B** | User-provided | Has existing image assets |
| **C** | AI-generated | Custom illustrations, backgrounds needed |
| **D** | Placeholders | Images to be added later |

**When selection includes B**, you must run `python3 scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` before outputting the spec, and integrate scan results into the image resource list.

**When B/C/D is selected**, add an image resource list to the spec:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Filename | e.g., `cover_bg.png` |
| Dimensions | e.g., `1280x720` |
| Ratio | e.g., `1.78` |
| Layout suggestion | e.g., `Wide landscape (suitable for full-screen/illustration)` |
| Purpose | e.g., `Cover background` |
| Type | Background / Photography / Illustration / Diagram / Decorative pattern |
| Status | Pending generation / Existing / Placeholder |
| Generation description | Fill in detailed description for AI generation |

**Generation description quality guide** — the description is the seed for Image_Generator's prompt, so specificity matters:

| Quality | Example | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Bad | "team photo" | Too vague — style, setting, lighting, composition all unknown |
| Good | "Professional team of 4 diverse people collaborating at a modern office desk, natural lighting, laptop visible" | Specifies subject count, setting, lighting, and props |
| Bad | "tech background" | No color, style, or composition guidance |
| Good | "Abstract flowing digital waves in deep navy (#1E3A5F) to midnight blue gradient, subtle particle effects, clean center area for text overlay" | Specifies subject, colors with HEX, effects, and text area needs |
| Bad | "chart" | Image_Generator cannot know what type of chart or data |
| Good | "Clean flowchart showing 4 sequential steps connected by arrows, flat design, light gray background, blue accent nodes" | Specifies diagram type, count, style, colors |

**Image type descriptions**:

| Type | Suitable Scenarios |
|------|-------------------|
| Background | Full-page backgrounds for covers/chapter pages; reserve text area |
| Photography | Real scenes, people, products, architecture |
| Illustration | Flat design, vector style, concept diagrams |
| Diagram | Flowcharts, architecture diagrams, concept relationship maps |
| Decorative pattern | Partial decoration, textures, borders, divider elements |

**Image narrative intent** (decide this *before* consulting the ratio table — it determines whether the image even lives in a container):

| Intent | Form | When to use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Hero / full-bleed** | Image fills the canvas (or a dominant zone); title / caption floats over with a gradient or opacity overlay for legibility | Covers, chapter dividers, `breathing` impact pages — when the image *is* the message, not a companion to body copy |
| **Atmosphere / background layer** | Image sits behind content as a low-contrast backdrop (reduced opacity or dark overlay); content reads against the treated layer | Section backgrounds, mood-setting pages — when the image sets tone but text carries the information |
| **Side-by-side** | Image and text occupy adjacent blocks as coequal units — the ratio table below governs container sizing in this case | Most content pages — when image and explanation need to be read together |
| **Accent / inline** | Small image tucked next to related text as an illustrative element, not a container; no forced ratio matching | Supporting visuals, spot illustrations, small diagrams explaining a term |

> Intent is driven by **what the image is doing narratively**, not by image ratio. The same 16:9 photo can be a hero on one page and a side-by-side block on the next depending on the page's purpose. Do not default every image-bearing page to side-by-side.

**Side-by-side ratio alignment** (consult only when the chosen intent is *side-by-side*; detailed calculation rules in `references/image-layout-spec.md`):

| Image Ratio | Recommended Container Layout |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| > 2.0 (ultra-wide) | Top-bottom split, top full-width |
| 1.5-2.0 (wide) | Top-bottom split |
| 1.2-1.5 (standard landscape) | Left-right split |
| 0.8-1.2 (square) | Left-right split |
| < 0.8 (portrait) | Left-right split, image on left |

Core logic (side-by-side only): the container's aspect ratio must closely match the image's original ratio. Never force a wide image into a square container or a portrait image into a narrow horizontal strip. For hero / atmosphere / accent intents, ratio alignment is not a constraint — composition is governed by the page's narrative, not the image's numeric ratio.

> **Portrait canvases** (Xiaohongshu, Story): Layout rules differ — top-bottom is preferred for most ratios since left-right columns become too narrow. See "Portrait Canvas Override" in `references/image-layout-spec.md`.

> **Multi-image slides**: When multiple images appear on one page, use the grid formulas in the "Multi-Image Layout" section of `references/image-layout-spec.md`.

> **Pipeline handoff**: When C) AI generation is selected, after outputting the design spec, prompt the user to invoke Image_Generator. Once images are collected in `images/`, proceed to Executor.

### Visualization Reference (Non-blocking — Strategist recommends, no user confirmation needed)

When content outline pages involve **data visualization or infographic-style structured information design** (comparisons, trends, proportions, KPIs, flows, timelines, org structures, strategic frameworks, etc.), Strategist should select appropriate visualization types from the built-in template library.

> **Mandatory first step**: At the beginning of content planning, **read the full `templates/charts/charts_index.json`** file. This index contains all available visualization templates (52 types across 8 categories), including each template's `summary`, `bestFor`, `avoidFor`, and `keywords`. Strategist must internalize the full catalog before making selections — do NOT rely on memory or partial lists.

> **Selection workflow**:
> 1. Read and internalize the complete `templates/charts/charts_index.json`
> 2. For each page in the content outline, determine whether it needs visualization based on its information structure
> 3. Match page content against the `bestFor` / `avoidFor` / `keywords` fields across all 52 templates to find the best fit
> 4. Use `quickLookup` as a secondary cross-reference when multiple candidates seem suitable
> 5. List all selected visualizations in Design Spec **section VII (Visualization Reference List)** as a centralized reference; in section IX Content Outline, each page only needs to note the visualization type name
>
> **Rules**:
> - Strategist is responsible for **semantic selection** (which type fits the content), not detailed SVG styling
> - One page may use at most one primary visualization type; complex pages may combine a chart with a supporting layout
> - Prefer specificity: if `vertical_list` fits better than generic `numbered_steps`, choose the more specific template
> - When no built-in template fits, note "custom layout" instead of forcing a poor match

### Speaker Notes Requirements (Default — no discussion needed)

- File naming: Recommended to match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`), also compatible with `notes/slide01.md`
- Fill in the Design Spec: total presentation duration, notes style (formal / conversational / interactive), presentation purpose (inform / persuade / inspire / instruct / report)
- Split note files must NOT contain `#` heading lines (`notes/total.md` master document MUST use `#` heading lines)

## 4. Layout Pattern Library

> **Principle — proportion follows information weight, not preset ratios.** This is a pattern library, not a menu. Combine patterns on one page, break the grid for `breathing` pages, or propose a pattern not listed when the content calls for it. Defaulting every page to a symmetric grid is what produces the "AI-generated" look.

| Pattern | Suitable Scenarios | PPT 16:9 Reference Dimensions |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Single column centered | Covers, conclusions, key points | Content width 800-1000px, horizontally centered |
| Symmetric split (5:5) | Comparisons where two sides carry equal weight | Column ratio 1:1, gap 40-60px |
| Asymmetric split (3:7 / 2:8) | One side dominates — chart vs. takeaway, image vs. caption | Heavier side 840-1024px, lighter side 256-440px |
| Three-column | Parallel points, process steps | Column ratio 1:1:1, gap 30-40px |
| Four-quadrant / matrix | Two-axis classification, strategic quadrants | Quadrant 560x250px, gap 20-30px |
| Top-bottom split | Ultra-wide images + text, processes, timelines | Image full-width, text area >= 150px height |
| Z-pattern / waterfall | Storytelling, case studies — blocks alternate left/right | Guide eye in Z; 3-5 alternating blocks |
| Center-radiating | Core concept + surrounding nodes | Center element 200-300px, 4-6 satellite nodes |
| Full-bleed + floating text | `breathing` / feature pages | Image fills 1280x720, text floats over opacity overlay |
| Figure-text overlap | Hero moments — headline over/against image edge | Text partially overlaps image, not beside it |
| Negative-space-driven | Single element in 40-60% whitespace | One idea, weight through emptiness |

**PPT 16:9 (1280x720) key dimensions**: Safe area 1200x640 (40px margins); Title area 1200x100; Content area 1200x500; Footer area 1200x40.

---

## 5. Template Flexibility Principle

> Templates are starting points, not endpoints. **The layout list is a pattern library, not a menu** — combine patterns on one page, or propose a pattern outside the list when the content demands it.

The Strategist should make professional judgments on the template basis generated by `scripts/project_manager.py`, considering user needs, content characteristics, and audience:

1. Ratio systems are adjustable (font size ratios are reference values)
2. Color schemes are customizable (based on brand and content)
3. Layout patterns can be combined, nested, or broken (see §4 Layout Pattern Library — 11 patterns as reference, not an exhaustive list)
4. Content structure is extensible (12-chapter framework can be expanded or reduced)
5. Spacing / border radius details adjusted by Executor based on content density and `page_rhythm` tag

---

## 6. Workflow & Deliverables

### 6.1 Content Planning Strategy

| Style | Content Outline | Design Spec | Speaker Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| A) General Versatile | Intelligently deconstruct source doc; define core theme per page | Visual theme, color scheme, layout principles | Concise presentation script |
| B) General Consulting | Structured logical sections; data-driven insights | Consulting-style colors, structured content layout | Professional terms, data interpretation, conclusion-first |
| C) Top Consulting | SCQA framework, pyramid principle conclusion-first | Data contextualization, strategic color usage | Highly condensed, logically rigorous, conclusion-driven |

### 6.2 Outline Output Specification (Must include 11 chapters)

| Chapter | Content Requirements |
|---------|---------------------|
| I. Project Information | Project name, canvas format, page count, style, audience, scenario, date |
| II. Canvas Specification | Format, dimensions, viewBox, margins, content area |
| III. Visual Theme | Style description, light/dark theme, tone, color scheme (with HEX table), gradient scheme |
| IV. Typography System | Font plan (per-role families — title / body / emphasis / code), font size hierarchy |
| V. Layout Principles | Page structure (header/content/footer zones), layout pattern library (combine/break as content demands), spacing spec |
| VI. Icon Usage Spec | Source description, placeholder syntax, recommended icon list |
| VII. Visualization Reference List | Visualization type, reference template path, used-in pages, purpose |
| VIII. Image Resource List | Filename, dimensions, ratio, purpose, status, generation description |
| IX. Content Outline | Grouped by chapter; each page includes layout, title, content points, visualization type (if applicable) |
| X. Speaker Notes Requirements | File naming rules, content structure description |
| XI. Technical Constraints Reminder | SVG generation rules, PPT compatibility rules |

**Generation steps**:
1. Read reference template: `templates/design_spec_reference.md`
2. Generate complete spec from scratch based on analysis
3. Save to: `projects/<project_name>.../design_spec.md`
4. **Generate execution lock**: read `templates/spec_lock_reference.md` and produce `projects/<project_name>.../spec_lock.md` — a distilled, machine-readable short form of the color / typography / icon / image / **page_rhythm** decisions above. This file is what the Executor re-reads before every page (see [executor-base.md](executor-base.md) §2.1). The values in `spec_lock.md` MUST exactly match the decisions recorded in `design_spec.md`; if they ever diverge, `spec_lock.md` wins and `design_spec.md` should be treated as historical narrative.
   - **page_rhythm is mandatory**: Based on the page list in §IX Content Outline, assign each page one of `anchor` / `dense` / `breathing` (see `spec_lock_reference.md` for the full vocabulary). This is what breaks the uniform "every page is a card grid" feel — without it the Executor defaults all pages to `dense`.
   - **Rhythm follows narrative, not quota**: `breathing` pages should appear at natural narrative pauses — chapter transitions, a single argument worth standalone emphasis (hero quote / big number / feature image), an SCQA "Question" bridge, or a deliberate stop after a chain of dense argumentation. If the content is genuinely a high-density data briefing or rigorous consulting analysis, the deck may legitimately be nearly all `dense` — **do NOT invent filler pages** ("Thank you", "Chapter divider with no content") to pad the rhythm, because filler is itself a hallmark AI-generated pattern. Validation test: every `breathing` page must answer "what independent thing is this page saying?" — if it can't, it shouldn't exist.

## 7. Project Folder

The project folder should be created before entering the Strategist role. If not yet created, execute:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> --format <canvas_format>
```

The Strategist saves the Design Specification & Content Outline to `projects/<project_name>_<format>_<YYYYMMDD>/design_spec.md`.

After writing `design_spec.md` **and** `spec_lock.md`, provide the next-step prompt based on the confirmed template option and image usage selection. This prompt is a workflow handoff instruction, not a section inside `design_spec.md`.

### Template Option A (Using existing template)

```
✅ Design spec complete. Template ready.
Next step:
- Images include AI generation → Invoke Image_Generator
- Images do not include AI generation → Invoke Executor
```

### Template Option B (No template)

```
✅ Design spec complete.
Next step:
- Images include AI generation → Invoke Image_Generator
- Images do not include AI generation → Invoke Executor (free design for every page)
```
